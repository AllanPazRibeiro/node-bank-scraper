# NodeJs Bank scraper (Ita√∫)

This project is the result of a test that consist into a bank scraper using nodejs + express

Componensts:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Install](#install)
- [Docker](#docker)
- [License](#license)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AllanPazRibeiro/node-bank-scraper.git
npm i
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**NOTE:** Do not forget to set the twitter, google, linkedin and github `CLIENT_ID`s and `SECRET`s. In `development` env, you can set the env variables in `.env` and replace the values there. In `production` env, it is not safe to keep the ids and secrets in a file, so you need to set it up via commandline. If you are using heroku checkout how environment variables are set [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

## Docker

You can also use docker for development. Make sure you run npm install on your host machine so that code linting and everything works fine.

```sh
npm i
```

Start the services

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

View the logs

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

In case you install a npm module while developing, it should also be installed within docker container, to do this first install the module you want with simple `npm i module name`, then run it within docker container

```sh
docker-compose exec node npm i
```

If you make any changes to the file, nodemon should automatically pick up and restart within docker (you can see this in the logs)

To run tests

```sh
docker-compose exec -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/noobjs_test node npm test
```

Note that we are overriding the environment variable set in `.env` file because we don't want our data erased by the tests.

Note: The difference between exec and run is that, exec executes the command within the running container and run will spin up a new container to run that command. So if you want to run only the tests without docker-compose up, you may do so by running `docker-compose run -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/noobjs_test node npm test`
